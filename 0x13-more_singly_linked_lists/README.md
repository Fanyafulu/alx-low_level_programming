How to use linked lists
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

Applications of linked list in computer science:

Implementation of stacks and queues

Implementation of graphs: Adjacency list representation of graphs is the most popular which uses a linked list to store adjacent vertices.

Dynamic memory allocation: We use a linked list of free blocks.

Maintaining a directory of names

Performing arithmetic operations on long integers

Manipulation of polynomials by storing constants in the node of the linked list

representing sparse matrices
