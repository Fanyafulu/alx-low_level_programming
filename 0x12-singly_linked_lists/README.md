linked list is the most sought-after data structure when it comes to handling dynamic data elements. A linked list consists of a data element known as a node. And each node consists of two fields: one field has data, and in the second field, the node has an address that keeps a reference to the next node.


A linked list is a linear data structure that stores a collection of data elements dynamically.

Nodes represent those data elements, and links or pointers connect each node.

Each node consists of two fields, the information stored in a linked list and a pointer that stores the address of its next node.

The last node contains null in its second field because it will point to no node.

A linked list can grow and shrink its size, as per the requirement.

It does not waste memory space.
